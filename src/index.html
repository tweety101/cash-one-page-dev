                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        With its growing popularity among the general populace, hemp and its derivative products are
                        more in demand than ever before. Because of this an increasing number of corporate brands are
                        launching their own hemp derived product lines, requiring quality reliable cannabinoids. Thus we
                        have a lucrative buyers market that is struggling to meet current supply needs. Furthermore
                        batch processing, which has been the standard, is costly and requires constant monitoring.

                        chromatography, we are able to keep operational costs very low. With total Wattage draw of under
                        600, electricity costs for 24 hour operation are sub $100 per month. Running the entire
                        self-contained process requires only 2 employees per shift.

                    <p>
                        Due in large part to its proprietary manufacturing system, CASH is a low cost manufacturer and
                        distributor of high-quality refined CBD (ingestible Oil and Isolate). When commodity pricing
                        compresses margins CASH will remain a cost competitive CBD consumer products producer for
                        corporate
                        customers, and CASH owned branded products. The 2018 US Farm Bill provides CASH with a clear
                        nationwide legal framework, providing less strict Hemp laws, and greater uniformity is expected
                        across the US. Industry experts see developed markets across the globe following this Hemp CBD
                        market phenomena, and the industry expects to grow exponentially in the US, and globally. The
                        consumer markets law of the jungle suggests only brands professionally developed and managed
                        with
                        high-quality innovative products will continue to thrive in this market.

                            The process is rather complicated. The single advantage which it brings to a chromatographic
                            purification is that it allows the production of large quantities of highly purified
                            material at a dramatically reduced cost. The cost reductions come about as a result of the
                            use of a smaller amount of chromatographic separation media stationary phase, a continuous
                            and high rate of production, and decreased solvent and energy requirements.​.
